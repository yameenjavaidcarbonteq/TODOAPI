Authentication is the process of verifying the identity of a user or entity. 
It involves confirming that the user is who they claim to be by verifying their 
credentials, such as a username and password, biometric information, or a digital 
certificate. The main goal of authentication is to ensure that only authorized 
users are granted access to resources.

Authorization, on the other hand, is the process of determining what actions or 
operations a user is allowed to perform once they have been authenticated. It 
involves checking the user's permissions or privileges to access specific resources 
or perform specific actions. The main goal of authorization is to control the access 
of authenticated users to resources based on their role, responsibilities, and privileges.

To summarize, authentication is the process of verifying a user's identity, while authorization 
is the process of determining what that user is allowed to do after their identity 
has been verified.
