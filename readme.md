src is the root directory of the project.

application contains the application layer, which represents the use cases and services that implement the business logic of the application.

applicationusecases contains the use case classes that define the operations that can be performed on the domain entities.

applicationservices contains the service classes that implement the business logic of the application.

applicationmiddlewares contains the middleware classes that define the common request processing logic for the application.

applicationroutes contains the route classes that define the URL endpoints for the application.

domain contains the domain layer, which represents the core business logic of the application.

domainentities contains the entity classes that represent the core business objects of the application.

domainrepositories contains the repository classes that define the operations that can be performed on the domain entities.

infrastructure contains the infrastructure layer, which represents the implementation details of the application.

infrastructuremongodb contains the MongoDB implementation details of the application.

infrastructuremongodbTodoAdapter.js contains the adapter class that translates between the MongoDB data and the domain entities for the Todo entity.

infrastructuremongodbTodoRepository.js contains the repository class that implements the CRUD operations on the Todo entity in MongoDB.

infrastructuremongodbUserAdapter.js contains the adapter class that translates between the MongoDB data and the domain entities for the User entity.

infrastructuremongodbUserRepository.js contains the repository class that implements the CRUD operations on the User entity in MongoDB.

This directory structure follows the Domain-Driven Design (DDD) approach to software development, with a clear separation between the domain layer, the application layer, and the infrastructure layer. The use of adapters helps to keep the domain entities isolated from the underlying storage technology, making it easier to switch to a different database or data format in the future without affecting the core business logic of the application.

CodeBase -> One codebase tracked in revision control, many deploys

Dependency -> I use npm i instead of global install and i am isolations by package.json 

    "dependencies": {
    "cors": "^2.8.5",
    "express": "^4.18.2",
    "morgan": "^1.10.0",
    "mysql2": "^2.3.3",
    "sequelize": "^6.28.0"
  }
        -> Hence when i run npm install it will load the node modules with the version
        in package.json so my dev prod and feature branches dont crash due to versions
        of deps

        KEY NOTE:

        -> The '^'' symbol indicates that you want to use the latest version of the express package that is compatible with version 4.17.1. So, if the latest version of express is 4.17.3, that version will be installed. However, if a new major version of express (such as 5.0.0) is released that is not compatible with version 4.17.1, then npm will not install it, and will instead install the latest version that is compatible (in this case, 4.17.3).

        By specifying a version range with the ^ symbol, you ensure that your application stays up-to-date with bug fixes and new features, but at the same time, you prevent it from breaking if a new major version of a package is released with breaking changes.

        You can also use other version range specifiers such as ~ and > to specify different ranges of compatible versions. The exact behavior of each range specifier can be found in the npm documentation.

Config
    Ill be making a .env file to store
    -> mongo URI
    -> ip address (hostname)
    -> port
    -> Google OAuth API Key
        GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID=your_client_id
        GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET=your_client_secret

    for Now.

    Middleware functions are functions that have access to the request object (req), 
    the response object (res), and the next middleware function in the applicationâ€™s 
    request-response cycle. 
    The next middleware function is commonly denoted by a variable named next.

    Middleware functions can perform the following tasks:

    Execute any code.
    Make changes to the request and the response objects.
    End the request-response cycle.
    Call the next middleware in the stack.

    Types of express middleware

    Application level middleware app.use
    Router level middleware router.use
    Built-in middleware express.static,express.json,express.urlencoded
    Error handling middleware app.use(err,req,res,next)
    Thirdparty middleware bodyparser,cookieparser

    Application Level Middleware
    
    Auth middleware

    Suppose we are having five routes getUsers,getDetails,updateDetails,isLoggedIn,isLoggedOut
    every route must be authenticated if the user is not authenticated then he is not able to call the above mentioned routes,so every GET,POST calls fromd authentication.In this case we build a authtication middleware.

    Now once the request comes the auth middleware will do some authentication logic that we have 
    written inside it.Once authentication successful then remaining routed must be called using next()
    if auth fails then it wont perform next route exit the middleware with error response logic
